We provide [macOS](#macos) and [web-based](#web) simulators for development purposes and to let you try out StatusPanel before building your own.

# Web

Get started by tapping 'Add Device' in StatusPanel on your iPhone or iPad and scanning the QR code.

We don't currently offer pre-built version of the macOS simulator. You can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/inseven/statuspanel/tree/main/simulator/macos).
