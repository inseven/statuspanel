In order to ease prototyping and development, we have two hardware platforms:

- **ESP32** (Lua) \
  Low-power, robust to power cycling and perfect for battery powered devices.
- **Raspberry Pi** (Python) \
  Enables incredibly rapid bring-up and testing of new screens as they are often well supported on Raspberry Pis.

Our long-term focus is on designing a custom PCB for ESP32-based devices.
