There are three versions of StatusPanel with each being defined by its choice of display:

- **[Version 1](v1)**--[Waveshare 640x384 7.5" Three-Color E-Ink HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.waveshare.com/7.5inch-e-paper-hat-c.htm) \
  ![](v1/hero.jpg)
- **[Version 2](v2)**--[Pimoroni Inky Impression 4](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-4?variant=39599238807635) \
  ![](v2/hero.jpg)
- **[Mini](mini)**--[Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5300)

In order to ease prototyping and development, we have two hardware platforms:

- **ESP32** (Lua) \
  Low-power, robust to power cycling and perfect for battery powered devices.
- **Raspberry Pi** (Python) \
  Enables incredibly rapid bring-up and testing of new screens as they are often well supported on Raspberry Pis.

Our long-term focus is on designing a custom PCB for ESP32-based devices.
