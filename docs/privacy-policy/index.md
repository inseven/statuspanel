title: Privacy Policy
---

StatusPanel uses end-to-end encryption to ensure your data remains private to you. Keys are exchanged directly between StatusPanel and your phone and are used to encrypt all updates; no one but you can see the content of your updates, including us.

Updates are temporarily stored (in their encrypted form) on a central message box service which devices check for updates. We require user accounts to use this service to allow us to minimise the risk of abuse and denial of service attacks to our infrastructure.

The following data is associated with your user account:

- **encrypted updates**--linking them to your account allows us to implement per-user rate limiting
- **device identifiers**--StatusPanel devices generate new random globally unique identifiers each time they are reset and are used to look up per-device updates
- **name and email address**--these allow us to share important updates with you, including any changes to this privacy policy
- **Anonymised device identifiers and device type**--Apple generates unique non-identifying device identifiers which we use to send background push notifications to ensure timely StatusPanel updates

Should this policy change in the future, we will make all reasonable efforts to inform you and provide mechanisms to opt-out.
