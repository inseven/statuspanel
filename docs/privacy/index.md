StatusPanel uses end-to-end encryption to ensure your data remains private to you. Keys exchanged directly between StatusPanel and your phone are used to encrypt all updates; no one but you can see your updates.

StatusPanel can optionally show a privacy image or redact content at the touch of a button if you're worried who might see your calendar.
